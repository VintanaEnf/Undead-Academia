## Game Concept
In this gripping 3rd person perspective game, immerse yourself in the eerie
confines of a university after dark. As the main character, awakens to a desolate scene
where the once vibrant campus is now haunted by the undead presence. Locked doors and
blocked exits confine you within the silent halls, and your mission unfolds: stealthily
traverse the university, collecting crucial items that hold the key to your escape. Navigate
the shadows, and solve puzzles. Can you survive the night and unravel the mysteries that
shroud this place?

## Game Genre
A blend of **escape, stealth, puzzle, mystery, and survival games** characterize our
genre. To escape dangerous situations, players must sneak around, figure out puzzles, and
survive while solving mysteries. Remaining hidden, searching around for hints, and
putting the puzzle pieces together will get you out. The voyage is just as thrilling as the
destination since every step forward brings with it new opportunities and discoveries.
